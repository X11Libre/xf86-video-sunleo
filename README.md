xf86-video-sunleo - Leo video driver for the XLibre X server
------------------------------------------------------------

This is an Xorg driver for Sun Leo (ZX) video cards.

Also known as the ZX or T(urbo)ZX, Leo is a 24 bit accelerated 3D
graphics card. Both cards are double-width, but the TZX also requires
extra cooling in the form of an additional double-width fan card, so
effectively takes up 4 SBus slots.

Sun supported these devices in SPARC systems ranging from the
SPARCstation 2 to the Ultra 2 workstation.
